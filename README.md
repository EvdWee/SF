- Jupyter notebook to re-scale 3D microscopy data using the depth-dependent re-scaling factor:

  Data used for re-scaling was presented in "Tutorial: avoiding and correcting sample-induced spherical aberration artifacts in 3D fluorescence microscopy" by Diel et al. - https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-0360-2

  We thank the authors for kindly sharing the data.
